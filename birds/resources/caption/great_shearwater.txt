Large shearwater with a prominent white collar and a well-defined dark cap. At close range, also note the bird’s scaly dark upperwings and back, and the narrow white band at the base of the tail.

Immature birds and adults in late fall and winter lack a white collar, but otherwise show the same color pattern as other Great Shearwaters on the water—dark head, upperparts, and undertail contrasting with a white chin, throat, and breast. All ages have a long, black bill with a hooked tip. 

In flight, the underwings and underparts are mostly white, with irregular brown marks on the wings and belly. 

On the underwing, the wingtips and trailing edges are dark; the white “armpits” show a variable amount of brown. 

Often rests on water in groups. Birds on the water show a strong black-and-white contrast.
